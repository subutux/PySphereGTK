How to run
==========

First off, you'll need the http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/ library files installed

(check out from svn source : svn checkout http://pysphere.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pysphere-read-only )

Run the app.py file.

Make shure you've got the Gi.repository python gtk libraries. (for GUI)
